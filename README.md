# Usage

The shopping cart application allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

Home
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a list of products on the home page. Each product card displays the product name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.

Cart
Clicking the "Add to Cart" button will add the selected product to the cart. The cart icon in the top right corner of the page will display the number of items currently in the cart. Clicking the cart icon will navigate you to the cart page.

On the cart page, you will see a summary of the items added to your cart. You can increase or decrease the quantity of each item or remove it entirely. The total cost of the items in the cart will be displayed at the bottom of the page.

Checkout
To proceed with the checkout process, click the "Checkout" button on the cart page. This will take you to the checkout page.

On the checkout page, you will be prompted to enter your personal information, such as name, email, and shipping address. Once you fill in the required details, click the "Place Order" button to complete the checkout process.

# Customization
You can customize various aspects of the shopping cart application to suit your needs:

Product Data: Modify the data folder to change the list of available products. Each product object should have a unique id, name, price, and image URL.

Styling: Customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the CSS files in the src/styles directory.

Additional Functionality: Feel free to extend the application with additional features, such as sorting products, filtering by category, or implementing user authentication.
